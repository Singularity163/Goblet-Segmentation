# Goblet-Segmentation

This repository is for pipeline and software for the Quantitative Analysis of Goblet Cells.

### Pipeline

In short, the pipeline consists of:

1. Inputting image through an optional preprocessing + watershed step to identify cell locations (AKA prompts).
2. Passsing automatically generated and/or manual prompts into the Segment Anything Model (SAM) by Meta.
3. Running analysis on the binary masks generated by SAM to generate information about the cells.

### Future works can include:

- Modernizing and updating GUI
- Finetuning SAM specific to use case
- Updating / replacing Watershed technique with more robust prompt generation techniques

## Installation

Requirements should be installed based on user's PC specs. Using `pip`, install `requirements.txt` for CUDA enabled PCs, and `requirements_ngpu.txt` otherwise.
